# Shorts Weather 5.0

* _JS geolocation_ - No more typing in your city! What are you, a person with fingers!? Sheesh.
* _Responsive layout_ - You got a mobile device? I got a mobile layout!
* _Next.js_ - Now using React & Next. It's cool.
* _Forecast.IO_ - Using a better Weather API but it did mean I had to build [an API proxy](https://github.com/tommyp/shorts-api)
